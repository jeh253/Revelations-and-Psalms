         <h2>Chapter: 1</h2>
         <p> 
            			1. Blessed is the man who doesn’t walk in the counsel of the wicked,nor stand on the path of sinners,nor sit in the seat of scoffers;<br/>
            			2. but his delight is in Yahweh’s law. On his law he meditates day and night.<br/>
            			3. He will be like a tree planted by the streams of water,that produces its fruit in its season,whose leaf also does not wither. Whatever he does shall prosper.<br/>
            			4. The wicked are not so,but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.<br/>
            			5. Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment,nor sinners in the congregation of the
            righteous.<br/>
            			6. For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous,but the way of the wicked shall perish.
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 2</h2>
         <p>
            			1. Why do the nations rage,and the peoples plot a vain thing?<br/>
            			2. The kings of the earth take a stand,and the rulers take counsel together,against Yahweh,
            and against his Anointed, saying,<br/>
            			3. “Let’s break their bonds apart,and cast their cords from us.”<br/>
            			4. He who sits in the heavens will laugh. The Lord will have them in derision.<br/>
            			5. Then he will speak to them in his anger,and terrify them in his wrath<br/>
            			6. “Yet I have set my King on my holy hill of Zion.”<br/>
            			7. I will tell of the decree. Yahweh said to me, “You are my son. Today I have become your father.<br/>
            			8. Ask of me, and I will give the nations for your inheritance,the uttermost parts of the earth for your possession.<br/>
            			9. You shall break them with a rod of iron. You shall dash them in pieces like a potter’s
            vessel.”<br/>
            			10. Now therefore be wise, you kings. Be instructed, you judges of the earth.<br/>
            			11. Serve Yahweh with fear,and rejoice with trembling.<br/>
            			12. Give sincere homage to the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish on the way,for his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all those who take refuge in him.
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 3</h2>
         <p>
            			1. Yahweh, how my adversaries have increased!Many are those who rise up against me.<br/>
            			2. Many there are who say of my soul,“There is no help for him in God.”
            			<br/>
            			3. But you, Yahweh, are a shield around me,my glory, and the one who lifts up my head.<br/>
            			4. I cry to Yahweh with my voice,and he answers me out of his holy hill. 
            			<br/>
            			5. I laid myself down and slept. I awakened; for Yahweh sustains me.<br/>
            			6. I will not be afraid of tens of thousands of people who have set themselves against me on every side.<br/>
            			7. Arise, Yahweh!Save me, my God!For you have struck all of my enemies on the cheek bone. You have broken the teeth of the wicked.<br/>
            			8. Salvation belongs to Yahweh. Your blessing be on your people. 
            			
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 4</h2>
         <p>
            			1. Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness. Give me relief from my distress. Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer.<br/>
            			2. You sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor?Will you love vanity, and seek after falsehood?
            			<br/>
            			3. But know that Yahweh has set apart for himself him who is godly:Yahweh will hear when I call to him.<br/>
            			4. Stand in awe, and don’t sin. Search your own heart on your bed, and be still. 
            			<br/>
            			5. Offer the sacrifices of righteousness. Put your trust in Yahweh.<br/>
            			6. Many say, “Who will show us any good?”Yahweh, let the light of your face shine on us.<br/>
            			7. You have put gladness in my heart,more than when their grain and their new wine are increased.<br/>
            			8. In peace I will both lay myself down and sleep,for you, Yahweh alone, make me live in safety.
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 5</h2>
         <p>
            			1. Give ear to my words, Yahweh. Consider my meditation.<br/>
            			2. Listen to the voice of my cry, my King and my God;for I pray to you.<br/>
            			3. Yahweh, in the morning you shall hear my voice. In the morning I will lay my requests before you, and will watch expectantly.<br/>
            			4. For you are not a God who has pleasure in wickedness. Evil can’t live with you.<br/>
            			5. The arrogant shall not stand in your sight. You hate all workers of iniquity.<br/>
            			6. You will destroy those who speak lies. Yahweh abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.<br/>
            			7. But as for me, in the abundance of your loving kindness I will come into your house. I will bow toward your holy temple in reverence of you.<br/>
            			8. Lead me, Yahweh, in your righteousness because of my enemies. Make your way straight before my face.<br/>
            			9. For there is no faithfulness in their mouth. Their heart is destruction. Their throat is an open tomb. They flatter with their tongue.<br/>
            			10. Hold them guilty, God. Let them fall by their own counsels;Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions,for they have rebelled against you.<br/>
            			11. But let all those who take refuge in you rejoice,Let them always shout for joy, because you defend them. Let them also who love your name be joyful in you.<br/>
            			12. For you will bless the righteous. Yahweh, you will surround him with favor as with a shield.
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 6</h2>
         <p>
            			1. Yahweh, don’t rebuke me in your anger,neither discipline me in your wrath.<br/>
            			2. Have mercy on me, Yahweh, for I am faint. Yahweh, heal me, for my bones are troubled.<br/>
            			3. My soul is also in great anguish. But you, Yahweh—how long?<br/>
            			4. Return, Yahweh. Deliver my soul,and save me for your loving kindness’ sake.<br/>
            			5. For in death there is no memory of you. In Sheol, who shall give you thanks?<br/>
            			6. I am weary with my groaning. Every night I flood my bed. I drench my couch with my tears.<br/>
            			7. My eye wastes away because of grief. It grows old because of all my adversaries.<br/>
            			8. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity,for Yahweh has heard the voice of my weeping.<br/>
            			9. Yahweh has heard my supplication. Yahweh accepts my prayer.<br/>
            			10. May all my enemies be ashamed and dismayed. They shall turn back, they shall be disgraced suddenly.
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 7</h2>
         <p>
            			1. Yahweh, my God, I take refuge in you. Save me from all those who pursue me, and deliver me,<br/>
            			2. lest they tear apart my soul like a lion,ripping it in pieces, while there is no one to deliver.<br/>
            			3. Yahweh, my God, if I have done this,if there is iniquity in my hands,<br/>
            			4. if I have rewarded evil to him who was at peace with me(yes, I have delivered him who without cause was my adversary),<br/>
            			5. let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it;yes, let him tread my life down to the earth,and lay my glory in the dust. 
            			<br/>
            			6. Arise, Yahweh, in your anger. Lift up yourself against the rage of my adversaries. Awake for me. You have commanded judgment.<br/>
            			7. Let the congregation of the peoples surround you. Rule over them on high.<br/>
            			8. Yahweh administers judgment to the peoples. Judge me, Yahweh, according to my righteousness,and to my integrity that is in me.<br/>
            			9. Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end,but establish the righteous;their minds and hearts are searched by the righteous God.<br/>
            			10. My shield is with God,who saves the upright in heart.<br/>
            			11. God is a righteous judge,yes, a God who has indignation every day.<br/>
            			12. If a man doesn’t repent, he will sharpen his sword;he has bent and strung his bow.<br/>
            			13. He has also prepared for himself the instruments of death. He makes ready his flaming arrows.<br/>
            			14. Behold, he travails with iniquity. Yes, he has conceived mischief,and brought out falsehood.<br/>
            			15. He has dug a hole,and has fallen into the pit which he made.<br/>
            			16. The trouble he causes shall return to his own head. His violence shall come down on
            the crown of his own head.<br/>
            			17. I will give thanks to Yahweh according to his righteousness,and will sing praise to the name of Yahweh Most High.
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 8</h2>
         <p>
            			1. Yahweh, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth!You have set your glory above the heavens!<br/>
            			2. From the lips of babes and infants you have established strength,because of your adversaries, that you might silence the enemy and the avenger.<br/>
            			3. When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers,the moon and the stars, which
            you have ordained;<br/>
            			4. what is man, that you think of him?What is the son of man, that you care for him?<br/>
            			5. For you have made him a little lower than the angels,and crowned him with glory and honor.<br/>
            			6. You make him ruler over the works of your hands. You have put all things under his feet:<br/>
            			7. All sheep and cattle,yes, and the animals of the field,<br/>
            			8. the birds of the sky, the fish of the sea,and whatever passes through the paths of
            the seas.<br/>
            			9. Yahweh, our Lord,how majestic is your name in all the earth!
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 9</h2>
         <p>
            			1. I will give thanks to Yahweh with my whole heart. I will tell of all your marvelous works.<br/>
            			2. I will be glad and rejoice in you. I will sing praise to your name, O Most High.<br/>
            			3. When my enemies turn back,they stumble and perish in your presence.<br/>
            			4. For you have maintained my just cause. You sit on the throne judging righteously.<br/>
            			5. You have rebuked the nations. You have destroyed the wicked. You have blotted out their name forever and ever.<br/>
            			6. The enemy is overtaken by endless ruin. The very memory of the cities which you have overthrown has perished.<br/>
            			7. But Yahweh reigns forever. He has prepared his throne for judgment.<br/>
            			8. He will judge the world in righteousness. He will administer judgment to the peoples in uprightness.<br/>
            			9. Yahweh will also be a high tower for the oppressed;a high tower in times of trouble.<br/>
            			10. Those who know your name will put their trust in you,for you, Yahweh, have not forsaken those who seek you.<br/>
            			11. Sing praises to Yahweh, who dwells in Zion,and declare among the people what he has done.<br/>
            			12. For he who avenges blood remembers them. He doesn’t forget the cry of the afflicted.<br/>
            			13. Have mercy on me, Yahweh. See my affliction by those who hate me,and lift me up from the gates of death;<br/>
            			14. that I may show all of your praise. In the gates of the daughter of Zion, I will rejoice in your salvation.<br/>
            			15. The nations have sunk down in the pit that they made. In the net which they hid, their own foot is taken.<br/>
            			16. Yahweh has made himself known. He has executed judgment. The wicked is snared by the work of his own hands. 
            			<br/>
            			17. The wicked shall be turned back to Sheol,even all the nations that forget God.<br/>
            			18. For the needy shall not always be forgotten,nor the hope of the poor perish forever.<br/>
            			19. Arise, Yahweh! Don’t let man prevail. Let the nations be judged in your sight.<br/>
            			20. Put them in fear, Yahweh. Let the nations know that they are only men. 
            			
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 10</h2>
         <p>
            			1. Why do you stand far off, Yahweh?Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble?<br/>
            			2. In arrogance, the wicked hunt down the weak. They are caught in the schemes that they devise.<br/>
            			3. For the wicked boasts of his heart’s cravings. He blesses the greedy, and condemns Yahweh.<br/>
            			4. The wicked, in the pride of his face,has no room in his thoughts for God.<br/>
            			5. His ways are prosperous at all times. He is arrogant, and your laws are far from his sight. As for all his adversaries, he sneers at them.<br/>
            			6. He says in his heart, “I shall not be shaken. For generations I shall have no trouble.”<br/>
            			7. His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and oppression. Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.<br/>
            			8. He lies in wait near the villages. From ambushes, he murders the innocent. His eyes
            are secretly set against the helpless.<br/>
            			9. He lurks in secret as a lion in his ambush. He lies in wait to catch the helpless.
            He catches the helpless, when he draws him in his net.<br/>
            			10. The helpless are crushed. They collapse. They fall under his strength.<br/>
            			11. He says in his heart, “God has forgotten. He hides his face. He will never see it.”<br/>
            			12. Arise, Yahweh!God, lift up your hand!Don’t forget the helpless.<br/>
            			13. Why does the wicked person condemn God,and say in his heart, “God won’t call me into account?”<br/>
            			14. But you do see trouble and grief. You consider it to take it into your hand. You help the victim and the fatherless.<br/>
            			15. Break the arm of the wicked. As for the evil man, seek out his wickedness until you find none.<br/>
            			16. Yahweh is King forever and ever!The nations will perish out of his land.<br/>
            			17. Yahweh, you have heard the desire of the humble. You will prepare their heart. You will cause your ear to hear,<br/>
            			18. to judge the fatherless and the oppressed,that man who is of the earth may terrify no more.
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 11</h2>
         <p>
            			1. In Yahweh, I take refuge. How can you say to my soul, “Flee as a bird to your mountain”?<br/>
            			2. For, behold, the wicked bend their bows. They set their arrows on the strings,that they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart.<br/>
            			3. If the foundations are destroyed,what can the righteous do?<br/>
            			4. Yahweh is in his holy temple. Yahweh is on his throne in heaven. His eyes observe.
            His eyes examine the children of men.<br/>
            			5. Yahweh examines the righteous,but the wicked and him who loves violence his soul hates.<br/>
            			6. On the wicked he will rain blazing coals;fire, sulfur, and scorching wind shall be
            the portion of their cup.<br/>
            			7. For Yahweh is righteous. He loves righteousness. The upright shall see his face.
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 12</h2>
         <p>
            			1. Help, Yahweh; for the godly man ceases. For the faithful fail from among the children of men.<br/>
            			2. Everyone lies to his neighbor. They speak with flattering lips, and with a double
            heart.<br/>
            			3. May Yahweh cut off all flattering lips,and the tongue that boasts,<br/>
            			4. who have said, “With our tongue we will prevail. Our lips are our own. Who is lord over us?”<br/>
            			5. “Because of the oppression of the weak and because of the groaning of the needy,I will now arise,” says Yahweh;“I will set him in safety from those who malign him.”<br/>
            			6. Yahweh’s words are flawless words,as silver refined in a clay furnace, purified seven
            times.<br/>
            			7. You will keep them, Yahweh. You will preserve them from this generation forever.<br/>
            			8. The wicked walk on every side,when what is vile is exalted among the sons of men.
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 13</h2>
         <p>
            			1. How long, Yahweh?Will you forget me forever?How long will you hide your face from
            me?<br/>
            			2. How long shall I take counsel in my soul,having sorrow in my heart every day?How long
            shall my enemy triumph over me?<br/>
            			3. Behold, and answer me, Yahweh, my God. Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death;<br/>
            			4. lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed against him;”lest my adversaries rejoice when I fall.<br/>
            			5. But I trust in your loving kindness. My heart rejoices in your salvation.<br/>
            			6. I will sing to Yahweh,because he has been good to me.
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 14</h2>
         <p>
            			1. The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.”They are corrupt. They have done abominable deeds. There is no one who does good.<br/>
            			2. Yahweh looked down from heaven on the children of men,to see if there were any who
            understood,who sought after God.<br/>
            			3. They have all gone aside. They have together become corrupt. There is no one who does
            good, no, not one.<br/>
            			4. Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge,who eat up my people as they eat bread,and
            don’t call on Yahweh?<br/>
            			5. There they were in great fear,for God is in the generation of the righteous.<br/>
            			6. You frustrate the plan of the poor,because Yahweh is his refuge.<br/>
            			7. Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!When Yahweh restores the fortunes of his people,then Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel
            shall be glad.
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 15</h2>
         <p>
            			1. Yahweh, who shall dwell in your sanctuary?Who shall live on your holy hill?<br/>
            			2. He who walks blamelessly and does what is right,and speaks truth in his heart;<br/>
            			3. he who doesn’t slander with his tongue,nor does evil to his friend,nor casts slurs
            against his fellow man;<br/>
            			4. in whose eyes a vile man is despised,but who honors those who fear Yahweh;he who keeps
            an oath even when it hurts, and doesn’t change;<br/>
            			5. he who doesn’t lend out his money for usury,nor take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be shaken.
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 16</h2>
         <p>
            			1. Preserve me, God, for I take refuge in you.<br/>
            			2. My soul, you have said to Yahweh, “You are my Lord. Apart from you I have no good thing.”<br/>
            			3. As for the saints who are in the earth,they are the excellent ones in whom is all my delight.<br/>
            			4. Their sorrows shall be multiplied who give gifts to another god. Their drink offerings
            of blood I will not offer,nor take their names on my lips.<br/>
            			5. Yahweh assigned my portion and my cup. You made my lot secure.<br/>
            			6. The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places. Yes, I have a good inheritance.<br/>
            			7. I will bless Yahweh, who has given me counsel. Yes, my heart instructs me in the night seasons.<br/>
            			8. I have set Yahweh always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.<br/>
            			9. Therefore my heart is glad, and my tongue rejoices. My body shall also dwell in safety.<br/>
            			10. For you will not leave my soul in Sheol,neither will you allow your holy one to see
            corruption.<br/>
            			11. You will show me the path of life. In your presence is fullness of joy. In your right
            hand there are pleasures forever more.

            			1. Hear, Yahweh, my righteous plea;Give ear to my prayer, that doesn’t go out of deceitful
            lips.<br/>
            			2. Let my sentence come out of your presence. Let your eyes look on equity.<br/>
            			3. You have proved my heart. You have visited me in the night. You have tried me, and
            found nothing. I have resolved that my mouth shall not disobey.<br/>
            			4. As for the deeds of men, by the word of your lips,I have kept myself from the ways of the violent.<br/>
            			5. My steps have held fast to your paths. My feet have not slipped.<br/>
            			6. I have called on you, for you will answer me, God. Turn your ear to me. Hear my speech.<br/>
            			7. Show your marvelous loving kindness,you who save those who take refuge by your right
            hand from their enemies.<br/>
            			8. Keep me as the apple of your eye. Hide me under the shadow of your wings,<br/>
            			9. from the wicked who oppress me,my deadly enemies, who surround me.<br/>
            			10. They close up their callous hearts. With their mouth they speak proudly.<br/>
            			11. They have now surrounded us in our steps. They set their eyes to cast us down to the
            earth.<br/>
            			12. He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey,as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.<br/>
            			13. Arise, Yahweh, confront him. Cast him down. Deliver my soul from the wicked by your
            sword;<br/>
            			14. from men by your hand, Yahweh,from men of the world, whose portion is in this life.
            You fill the belly of your cherished ones. Your sons have plenty,and they store up
            wealth for their children.<br/>
            			15. As for me, I shall see your face in righteousness. I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with seeing
            your form.

         <h2>Chapter: 18</h2>
         <p>
            			1. I love you, Yahweh, my strength.<br/>
            			2. Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer;my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge;my
            shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.<br/>
            			3. I call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised;and I am saved from my enemies.<br/>
            			4. The cords of death surrounded me. The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.<br/>
            			5. The cords of Sheol were around me. The snares of death came on me.<br/>
            			6. In my distress I called on Yahweh,and cried to my God. He heard my voice out of his temple. My cry before him came into his ears.<br/>
            			7. Then the earth shook and trembled. The foundations also of the mountains quaked and were
            shaken,because he was angry.<br/>
            			8. Smoke went out of his nostrils. Consuming fire came out of his mouth. Coals were kindled by it.<br/>
            			9. He bowed the heavens also, and came down. Thick darkness was under his feet.<br/>
            			10. He rode on a cherub, and flew. Yes, he soared on the wings of the wind.<br/>
            			11. He made darkness his hiding place, his pavilion around him,darkness of waters, thick
            clouds of the skies.<br/>
            			12. At the brightness before him his thick clouds passed,hailstones and coals of fire.<br/>
            			13. Yahweh also thundered in the sky. The Most High uttered his voice:hailstones and coals of fire.<br/>
            			14. He sent out his arrows, and scattered them;Yes, great lightning bolts, and routed
            them.<br/>
            			15. Then the channels of waters appeared. The foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke, Yahweh,at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.<br/>
            			16. He sent from on high. He took me. He drew me out of many waters.<br/>
            			17. He delivered me from my strong enemy,from those who hated me; for they were too mighty for me.<br/>
            			18. They came on me in the day of my calamity,but Yahweh was my support.<br/>
            			19. He brought me out also into a large place. He delivered me, because he delighted in
            me.<br/>
            			20. Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness. According to the cleanness of
            my hands, he has recompensed me.<br/>
            			21. For I have kept the ways of Yahweh,and have not wickedly departed from my God.<br/>
            			22. For all his ordinances were before me. I didn’t put away his statutes from me.<br/>
            			23. I was also blameless with him. I kept myself from my iniquity.<br/>
            			24. Therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness,according to the cleanness
            of my hands in his eyesight.<br/>
            			25. With the merciful you will show yourself merciful. With the perfect man, you will
            show yourself perfect.<br/>
            			26. With the pure, you will show yourself pure. With the crooked you will show yourself
            shrewd.<br/>
            			27. For you will save the afflicted people,but the arrogant eyes you will bring down.<br/>
            			28. For you will light my lamp, Yahweh. My God will light up my darkness.<br/>
            			29. For by you, I advance through a troop. By my God, I leap over a wall.<br/>
            			30. As for God, his way is perfect. Yahweh’s word is tried. He is a shield to all those who take refuge
            in him.<br/>
            			31. For who is God, except Yahweh?Who is a rock, besides our God,<br/>
            			32. the God who arms me with strength, and makes my way perfect?<br/>
            			33. He makes my feet like deer’s feet,and sets me on my high places.<br/>
            			34. He teaches my hands to war,so that my arms bend a bow of bronze.<br/>
            			35. You have also given me the shield of your salvation. Your right hand sustains me.
            Your gentleness has made me great.<br/>
            			36. You have enlarged my steps under me,My feet have not slipped.<br/>
            			37. I will pursue my enemies, and overtake them. I won’t turn away until they are consumed.<br/>
            			38. I will strike them through, so that they will not be able to rise. They shall fall
            under my feet.<br/>
            			39. For you have armed me with strength to the battle. You have subdued under me those
            who rose up against me.<br/>
            			40. You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me,that I might cut off those who
            hate me.<br/>
            			41. They cried, but there was no one to save;even to Yahweh, but he didn’t answer them.<br/>
            			42. Then I beat them small as the dust before the wind. I cast them out as the mire of
            the streets.<br/>
            			43. You have delivered me from the strivings of the people. You have made me the head
            of the nations. A people whom I have not known shall serve me.<br/>
            			44. As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me. The foreigners shall submit themselves
            to me.<br/>
            			45. The foreigners shall fade away,and shall come trembling out of their strongholds.<br/>
            			46. Yahweh lives; and blessed be my rock. Exalted be the God of my salvation,<br/>
            			47. even the God who executes vengeance for me,and subdues peoples under me.<br/>
            			48. He rescues me from my enemies. Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against
            me. You deliver me from the violent man.<br/>
            			49. Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations,and will sing praises
            to your name.<br/>
            			50. He gives great deliverance to his king,and shows loving kindness to his anointed,to David and to his offspring, forever more.

            abhor evil.<br/>
            			5. Your loving kindness, Yahweh, is in the heavens. Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.<br/>
            			6. Your righteousness is like the mountains of God. Your judgments are like a great deep.
            Yahweh, you preserve man and animal.<br/>
            			7. How precious is your loving kindness, God!The children of men take refuge under the shadow of your wings.<br/>
            			8. They shall be abundantly satisfied with the abundance of your house. You will make them drink of the river of your pleasures.<br/>
            			9. For with you is the spring of life. In your light we will see light.<br/>
            			10. Oh continue your loving kindness to those who know you,your righteousness to the upright in heart.<br/>
            			11. Don’t let the foot of pride come against me. Don’t let the hand of the wicked drive
            me away.<br/>

            			24. Though he stumble, he shall not fall,for Yahweh holds him up with his hand.<br/>
            			25. I have been young, and now am old,yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken,nor his children begging for bread.<br/>
            			26. All day long he deals graciously, and lends. His offspring is blessed.<br/>
            			27. Depart from evil, and do good. Live securely forever.<br/>
            			28. For Yahweh loves justice,and doesn’t forsake his saints. They are preserved forever,but the children of the wicked shall be cut off.<br/>

            			30. The mouth of the righteous talks of wisdom. His tongue speaks justice.<br/>
            			31. The law of his God is in his heart. None of his steps shall slide.<br/>

            			35. I have seen the wicked in great power,spreading himself like a green tree in its native soil.<br/>
            			36. But he passed away, and behold, he was not. Yes, I sought him, but he could not be found.<br/>
            			37. Mark the perfect man, and see the upright,for there is a future for the man of peace.<br/>
            			38. As for transgressors, they shall be destroyed together. The future of the wicked shall be cut off.<br/>
            			39. But the salvation of the righteous is from Yahweh. He is their stronghold in the time
            of trouble.<br/>
            			40. Yahweh helps them, and rescues them. He rescues them from the wicked, and saves them,because

            			2. I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold. I have come into deep waters, where
            the floods overflow me.<br/>
            			3. I am weary with my crying. My throat is dry. My eyes fail, looking for my God.<br/>
            			4. Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head. Those who want
            to cut me off, being my enemies wrongfully, are mighty. I have to restore what I didn’t
            take away.<br/>
            			5. God, you know my foolishness. My sins aren’t hidden from you.<br/>
            			6. Don’t let those who wait for you be shamed through me, Lord Yahweh of Armies. Don’t
            let those who seek you be brought to dishonor through me, God of Israel.<br/>
            			7. Because for your sake, I have borne reproach. Shame has covered my face.<br/>
            			8. I have become a stranger to my brothers, an alien to my mother’s children.<br/>
            			9. For the zeal of your house consumes me. The reproaches of those who reproach you have
            fallen on me.<br/>
            			10. When I wept and I fasted, that was to my reproach.<br/>
            			11. When I made sackcloth my clothing,I became a byword to them.<br/>
            			12. Those who sit in the gate talk about me. I am the song of the drunkards.<br/>
            			13. But as for me, my prayer is to you, Yahweh, in an acceptable time. God, in the abundance of your loving kindness, answer me in the truth of your salvation.<br/>
            			14. Deliver me out of the mire, and don’t let me sink. Let me be delivered from those
            who hate me, and out of the deep waters.<br/>
            			15. Don’t let the flood waters overwhelm me, neither let the deep swallow me up. Don’t
            let the pit shut its mouth on me.<br/>
            			16. Answer me, Yahweh, for your loving kindness is good. According to the multitude of
            your tender mercies, turn to me.<br/>
            			17. Don’t hide your face from your servant,for I am in distress. Answer me speedily!<br/>
            			18. Draw near to my soul, and redeem it. Ransom me because of my enemies.<br/>
            			19. You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor. My adversaries are all before you.<br/>
            			20. Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness. I looked for some to take
            pity, but there was none; for comforters, but I found none.<br/>
            			21. They also gave me gall for my food. In my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink.<br/>
            			22. Let their table before them become a snare. May it become a retribution and a trap.<br/>
            			23. Let their eyes be darkened, so that they can’t see. Let their backs be continually
            bent.<br/>
            			24. Pour out your indignation on them. Let the fierceness of your anger overtake them.<br/>
            			25. Let their habitation be desolate. Let no one dwell in their tents.<br/>
            			26. For they persecute him whom you have wounded. They tell of the sorrow of those whom you have hurt.<br/>
            			27. Charge them with crime upon crime. Don’t let them come into your righteousness.<br/>
            			28. Let them be blotted out of the book of life, and not be written with the righteous.<br/>
            			29. But I am in pain and distress. Let your salvation, God, protect me.<br/>
            			30. I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.<br/>
            			31. It will please Yahweh better than an ox, or a bull that has horns and hoofs.<br/>
            			32. The humble have seen it, and are glad. You who seek after God, let your heart live.<br/>
            			33. For Yahweh hears the needy, and doesn’t despise his captive people.<br/>
            			34. Let heaven and earth praise him; the seas, and everything that moves therein!<br/>
            			35. For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah. They shall settle there, and
            own it.<br/>
            			36. The children also of his servants shall inherit it. Those who love his name shall dwell therein.

            			10. Then I thought, “I will appeal to this:the years of the right hand of the Most High.”<br/>
            			11. I will remember Yah’s deeds;for I will remember your wonders of old.<br/>
            			12. I will also meditate on all your work,and consider your doings.<br/>
            			13. Your way, God, is in the sanctuary. What god is great like God?<br/>
            			14. You are the God who does wonders. You have made your strength known among the peoples.<br/>
            			15. You have redeemed your people with your arm,the sons of Jacob and Joseph. 
            			<br/>
            			16. The waters saw you, God. The waters saw you, and they writhed. The depths also convulsed.<br/>
            			17. The clouds poured out water. The skies resounded with thunder. Your arrows also flashed
            around.<br/>
            			18. The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind. The lightnings lit up the world. The earth trembled and shook.<br/>
            			19. Your way was through the sea;your paths through the great waters. Your footsteps were
            not known.<br/>
            			20. You led your people like a flock,by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

            			1. Hear my teaching, my people. Turn your ears to the words of my mouth.<br/>
            			2. I will open my mouth in a parable. I will utter dark sayings of old,<br/>
            			3. Which we have heard and known,and our fathers have told us.<br/>
            			4. We will not hide them from their children, telling to the generation to come the praises of Yahweh,his strength, and his wondrous
            deeds that he has done.<br/>
            			5. For he established a covenant in Jacob,and appointed a teaching in Israel,which he
            commanded our fathers,that they should make them known to their children;<br/>
            			6. that the generation to come might know, even the children who should be born;who should
            arise and tell their children,<br/>
            			7. that they might set their hope in God,and not forget God’s deeds,but keep his commandments,<br/>
            			8. and might not be as their fathers,a stubborn and rebellious generation,a generation that didn’t make their hearts loyal,whose
            spirit was not steadfast with God.<br/>
            			9. The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,turned back in the day of battle.<br/>
            			10. They didn’t keep God’s covenant,and refused to walk in his law.<br/>
            			11. They forgot his doings,his wondrous deeds that he had shown them.<br/>
            			12. He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers,in the land of Egypt, in the
            field of Zoan.<br/>
            			13. He split the sea, and caused them to pass through. He made the waters stand as a heap.<br/>
            			14. In the daytime he also led them with a cloud,and all night with a light of fire.<br/>
            			15. He split rocks in the wilderness,and gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.<br/>
            			16. He brought streams also out of the rock,and caused waters to run down like rivers.<br/>
            			17. Yet they still went on to sin against him,to rebel against the Most High in the desert.<br/>
            			18. They tempted God in their heartby asking food according to their desire.<br/>
            			19. Yes, they spoke against God. They said, “Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?<br/>
            			20. Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out,and streams overflowed. Can
            he give bread also?Will he provide meat for his people?”<br/>
            			21. Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry. A fire was kindled against Jacob,anger also went up against
            Israel,<br/>
            			22. because they didn’t believe in God,and didn’t trust in his salvation.<br/>
            			23. Yet he commanded the skies above,and opened the doors of heaven.<br/>
            			24. He rained down manna on them to eat,and gave them food from the sky.<br/>
            			25. Man ate the bread of angels. He sent them food to the full.<br/>
            			26. He caused the east wind to blow in the sky. By his power he guided the south wind.<br/>
            			27. He rained also meat on them as the dust;winged birds as the sand of the seas.<br/>
            			28. He let them fall in the middle of their camp,around their habitations.<br/>
            			29. So they ate, and were well filled. He gave them their own desire.<br/>
            			30. They didn’t turn from their cravings. Their food was yet in their mouths,<br/>
            			31. when the anger of God went up against them,killed some of their fattest,and struck down
            the young men of Israel.<br/>
            			32. For all this they still sinned,and didn’t believe in his wondrous works.<br/>
            			33. Therefore he consumed their days in vanity,and their years in terror.<br/>
            			34. When he killed them, then they inquired after him. They returned and sought God earnestly.<br/>
            			35. They remembered that God was their rock,the Most High God, their redeemer.<br/>
            			36. But they flattered him with their mouth,and lied to him with their tongue.<br/>
            			37. For their heart was not right with him,neither were they faithful in his covenant.<br/>
            			38. But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn’t destroy them. Yes, many times he
            turned his anger away,and didn’t stir up all his wrath.<br/>
            			39. He remembered that they were but flesh,a wind that passes away, and doesn’t come again.<br/>
            			40. How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,and grieved him in the desert!<br/>
            			41. They turned again and tempted God,and provoked the Holy One of Israel.<br/>
            			42. They didn’t remember his hand,nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;<br/>
            			43. how he set his signs in Egypt,his wonders in the field of Zoan,<br/>
            			44. he turned their rivers into blood,and their streams, so that they could not drink.<br/>
            			45. He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;and frogs, which destroyed
            them.<br/>
            			46. He gave also their increase to the caterpillar,and their labor to the locust.<br/>
            			47. He destroyed their vines with hail,their sycamore fig trees with frost.<br/>
            			48. He gave over their livestock also to the hail,and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.<br/>
            			49. He threw on them the fierceness of his anger,wrath, indignation, and trouble,and a
            band of angels of evil.<br/>
            			50. He made a path for his anger. He didn’t spare their soul from death,but gave their
            life over to the pestilence,<br/>
            			51. and struck all the firstborn in Egypt,the chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.<br/>
            			52. But he led out his own people like sheep,and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.<br/>
            			53. He led them safely, so that they weren’t afraid,but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.<br/>
            			54. He brought them to the border of his sanctuary,to this mountain, which his right hand
            had taken.<br/>
            			55. He also drove out the nations before them,allotted them for an inheritance by line,and
            made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.<br/>
            			56. Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,and didn’t keep his testimonies;<br/>
            			57. but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers. They were twisted like a
            deceitful bow.<br/>
            			58. For they provoked him to anger with their high places,and moved him to jealousy with their
            engraved images.<br/>
            			59. When God heard this, he was angry,and greatly abhorred Israel;<br/>
            			60. So that he abandoned the tent of Shiloh,the tent which he placed among men;<br/>
            			61. and delivered his strength into captivity,his glory into the adversary’s hand.<br/>
            			62. He also gave his people over to the sword,and was angry with his inheritance.<br/>
            			63. Fire devoured their young men. Their virgins had no wedding song.<br/>
            			64. Their priests fell by the sword,and their widows couldn’t weep.<br/>
            			65. Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep,like a mighty man who shouts by reason
            of wine.<br/>
            			66. He struck his adversaries backward. He put them to a perpetual reproach.<br/>
            			67. Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph,and didn’t choose the tribe of Ephraim,<br/>
            			68. But chose the tribe of Judah,Mount Zion which he loved.<br/>
            			69. He built his sanctuary like the heights,like the earth which he has established forever.<br/>
            			70. He also chose David his servant,and took him from the sheepfolds;<br/>
            			71. from following the ewes that have their young,he brought him to be the shepherd of
            Jacob, his people,and Israel, his inheritance.<br/>
            			72. So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart,and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.

            			17. Unless Yahweh had been my help,my soul would have soon lived in silence.<br/>
            			18. When I said, “My foot is slipping!” Your loving kindness, Yahweh, held me up.<br/>
            			19. In the multitude of my thoughts within me, your comforts delight my soul.<br/>
            			20. Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with you,which brings about mischief
            by statute?<br/>
            			21. They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous,and condemn the
            innocent blood.<br/>
            			22. But Yahweh has been my high tower,my God, the rock of my refuge.<br/>
            			23. He has brought on them their own iniquity,and will cut them off in their own wickedness.
            Yahweh, our God, will cut them off.

            			15. “Don’t touch my anointed ones! Do my prophets no harm!”<br/>
            			16. He called for a famine on the land. He destroyed the food supplies.<br/>
            			17. He sent a man before them. Joseph was sold for a slave.<br/>
            			18. They bruised his feet with shackles. His neck was locked in irons,<br/>
            			19. until the time that his word happened,and Yahweh’s word proved him true.<br/>
            			20. The king sent and freed him;even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.<br/>
            			21. He made him lord of his house,and ruler of all of his possessions;<br/>
            			22. to discipline his princes at his pleasure,and to teach his elders wisdom.<br/>
            			23. Israel also came into Egypt. Jacob lived in the land of Ham.<br/>
            			24. He increased his people greatly,and made them stronger than their adversaries.<br/>
            			25. He turned their heart to hate his people,to conspire against his servants.<br/>
            			26. He sent Moses, his servant,and Aaron, whom he had chosen.<br/>
            			27. They performed miracles among them,and wonders in the land of Ham.<br/>
            			28. He sent darkness, and made it dark. They didn’t rebel against his words.<br/>
            			29. He turned their waters into blood,and killed their fish.<br/>
            			30. Their land swarmed with frogs,even in the rooms of their kings.<br/>
            			31. He spoke, and swarms of flies came,and lice in all their borders.<br/>
            			32. He gave them hail for rain,with lightning in their land.<br/>
            			33. He struck their vines and also their fig trees,and shattered the trees of their country.<br/>
            			34. He spoke, and the locusts came,and the grasshoppers, without number,<br/>
            			35. ate up every plant in their land;and ate up the fruit of their ground.<br/>
            			36. He struck also all the firstborn in their land,the first fruits of all their manhood.<br/>
            			37. He brought them out with silver and gold. There was not one feeble person among his
            tribes.<br/>
            			38. Egypt was glad when they departed,for the fear of them had fallen on them.<br/>
            			39. He spread a cloud for a covering,fire to give light in the night.<br/>
            			40. They asked, and he brought quails,and satisfied them with the bread of the sky.<br/>
            			41. He opened the rock, and waters gushed out. They ran as a river in the dry places.<br/>
            			42. For he remembered his holy word,and Abraham, his servant.<br/>
            			43. He brought his people out with joy,his chosen with singing.<br/>
            			44. He gave them the lands of the nations. They took the labor of the peoples in possession,<br/>
            			45. that they might keep his statutes,and observe his laws. Praise Yah!

            			7. Our fathers didn’t understand your wonders in Egypt. They didn’t remember the multitude
            of your loving kindnesses,but were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.<br/>
            			8. Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake,that he might make his mighty power known.<br/>
            			9. He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up;so he led them through the depths,
            as through a desert.<br/>
            			10. He saved them from the hand of him who hated them,and redeemed them from the hand
            of the enemy.<br/>
            			11. The waters covered their adversaries. There was not one of them left.<br/>
            			12. Then they believed his words. They sang his praise.<br/>
            			13. They soon forgot his works. They didn’t wait for his counsel,<br/>
            			14. but gave in to craving in the desert,and tested God in the wasteland.<br/>
            			15. He gave them their request,but sent leanness into their soul.<br/>
            			16. They envied Moses also in the camp,and Aaron, Yahweh’s saint.<br/>
            			17. The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan,and covered the company of Abiram.<br/>
            			18. A fire was kindled in their company. The flame burned up the wicked.<br/>
            			19. They made a calf in Horeb,and worshiped a molten image.<br/>
            			20. Thus they exchanged their glory for an image of a bull that eats grass.<br/>
            			21. They forgot God, their Savior,who had done great things in Egypt,<br/>
            			22. wondrous works in the land of Ham,and awesome things by the Red Sea.<br/>
            			23. Therefore he said that he would destroy them,had Moses, his chosen, not stood before him in
            the breach,to turn away his wrath, so that he wouldn’t destroy them.<br/>
            			24. Yes, they despised the pleasant land. They didn’t believe his word,<br/>
            			25. but murmured in their tents,and didn’t listen to Yahweh’s voice.<br/>
            			26. Therefore he swore to them that he would overthrow them in the wilderness,<br/>
            			27. that he would overthrow their offspring among the nations,and scatter them in the lands.<br/>
            			28. They joined themselves also to Baal Peor,and ate the sacrifices of the dead.<br/>
            			29. Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds. The plague broke in on them.<br/>
            			30. Then Phinehas stood up, and executed judgment,so the plague was stopped.<br/>
            			31. That was credited to him for righteousness,for all generations to come.<br/>
            			32. They angered him also at the waters of Meribah,so that Moses was troubled for their sakes;<br/>
            			33. because they were rebellious against his spirit,he spoke rashly with his lips.<br/>
            			34. They didn’t destroy the peoples,as Yahweh commanded them,<br/>
            			35. but mixed themselves with the nations,and learned their works.<br/>
            			36. They served their idols,which became a snare to them.<br/>
            			37. Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.<br/>
            			38. They shed innocent blood,even the blood of their sons and of their daughters,whom
            they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan. The land was polluted with blood.<br/>
            			39. Thus they were defiled with their works,and prostituted themselves in their deeds.<br/>
            			40. Therefore Yahweh burned with anger against his people. He abhorred his inheritance.<br/>
            			41. He gave them into the hand of the nations. Those who hated them ruled over them.<br/>
            			42. Their enemies also oppressed them. They were brought into subjection under their hand.<br/>
            			43. He rescued them many times,but they were rebellious in their counsel,and were brought low in their iniquity.<br/>
            			44. Nevertheless he regarded their distress,when he heard their cry.<br/>
            			45. He remembered for them his covenant,and repented according to the multitude of his
            loving kindnesses.<br/>
            			46. He made them also to be pitied by all those who carried them captive.<br/>
            			47. Save us, Yahweh, our God,gather us from among the nations,to give thanks to your holy
            name,to triumph in your praise!<br/>
            			48. Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel,from everlasting even to everlasting!Let all

            			12. Therefore he brought down their heart with labor. They fell down, and there was no one to help.<br/>
            			13. Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble,and he saved them out of their distresses.<br/>

            			17. Fools are afflicted because of their disobedience,and because of their iniquities.<br/>
            			18. Their soul abhors all kinds of food. They draw near to the gates of death.<br/>
            			19. Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble,he saves them out of their distresses.<br/>
            			20. He sends his word, and heals them,and delivers them from their graves.<br/>

            			26. They mount up to the sky; they go down again to the depths. Their soul melts away
            because of trouble.<br/>
            			27. They reel back and forth, and stagger like a drunken man,and are at their wits’ end.<br/>
            			28. Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble,and he brings them out of their distress.<br/>
            			29. He makes the storm a calm,so that its waves are still.<br/>

            			34. and a fruitful land into a salt waste,for the wickedness of those who dwell in it.<br/>

            			38. He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly. He doesn’t allow their
            livestock to decrease.<br/>
            			39. Again, they are diminished and bowed downthrough oppression, trouble, and sorrow.<br/>
            			40. He pours contempt on princes,and causes them to wander in a trackless waste.<br/>
            			41. Yet he lifts the needy out of their affliction,and increases their families like a flock.<br/>
            			42. The upright will see it, and be glad. All the wicked will shut their mouths.<br/>

            				Faithful and True Witness, the Beginning of God’s creation, says these things:<br/>
            			15. “I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish
            				you were cold or hot.<br/>
            			16. So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will
            				vomit you out of my mouth.<br/>
            			17. Because you say, ‘I am rich, and have gotten riches, and have
            				need of nothing;’ and don’t know that  you are the wretched one, miserable, poor,
            				blind, and naked;<br/>
            			18. I counsel you to buy from me gold refined by fire, that you
            				may become rich; and white garments, that you may clothe yourself, and that the
            				shame of your nakedness may not be revealed; and eye salve to anoint your eyes,
            that
            				you may see.<br/>
            			19. As many as I love, I reprove and chasten. Be zealous
            				therefore, and repent.<br/>
            			20. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my
            				voice and opens the door, then I will come in to him, and will dine with him,
            and he
            				with me.<br/>
            			21. He who overcomes, I will give to him to sit down with me on my
            				throne, as I also overcame, and sat down with my Father on his throne.<br/>
            			22. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the
            				assemblies.”
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 4</h2>
         <p>
            			1. After these things I looked and saw a door opened in heaven, and
            				the first voice that I heard, like a trumpet speaking with me, was one saying,
            “Come
            				up here, and I will show you the things which must happen after this.”<br/>
            			2. Immediately I was in the Spirit. Behold, there was a throne set
            				in heaven, and one sitting on the throne<br/>
            			3. that looked like a jasper stone and a sardius. There was a
            				rainbow around the throne, like an emerald to look at.<br/>
            			4. Around the throne were twenty-four thrones. On the thrones were
            				twenty-four elders sitting, dressed in white garments, with crowns of gold on
            their
            				heads.<br/>
            			5. Out of the throne proceed lightnings, sounds, and thunders.
            				There were seven lamps of fire burning before his throne, which are the seven
            				Spirits of God.<br/>
            			6. Before the throne was something like a sea of glass, similar to
            				crystal. In the middle of the throne, and around the throne were four living
            				creatures full of eyes before and behind.<br/>
            			7. The first creature was like a lion, and the second creature like
            				a calf, and the third creature had a face like a man, and the fourth was like
            a
            				flying eagle.<br/>
            			8. The four living creatures, each one of them having six wings,
            				are full of eyes around and within. They have no rest day and night, saying, “Holy,
            				holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to
            				come!”<br/>
            			9. When the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to him
            				who sits on the throne, to him who lives forever and ever,<br/>
            			10. the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the
            				throne, and worship him who lives forever and ever, and throw their crowns before
            				the throne, saying,<br/>
            			11. “Worthy are you, our Lord and God, the Holy One, to receive
            				the glory, the honor, and the power, for you created all things, and because of
            your
            				desire they existed, and were created!”
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 5</h2>
         <p>
            			1. I saw, in the right hand of him who sat on the throne, a book
            				written inside and outside, sealed shut with seven seals.<br/>
            			2. I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is
            				worthy to open the book, and to break its seals?”<br/>
            			3. No one in heaven above, or on the earth, or under the earth, was
            				able to open the book or to look in it.<br/>
            			4. Then I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the
            				book or to look in it.<br/>
            			5. One of the elders said to me, “Don’t weep. Behold, the Lion who
            				is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome: he who opens the book and
            				its seven seals.”<br/>
            			6. I saw in the middle of the throne and of the four living
            				creatures, and in the middle of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had
            been
            				slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God,
            sent
            				out into all the earth.<br/>
            			7. Then he came, and he took it out of the right hand of him who
            				sat on the throne.<br/>
            			8. Now when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and
            				the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one having a harp, and
            golden
            				bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.<br/>
            			9. They sang a new song, saying,“You are worthy to take the bookand
            				to open its seals:for you were killed,and bought us for God with your bloodout of
            				every tribe, language, people, and nation,<br/>
            			10. and made us kings and priests to our God,and we will reign on
            				the earth.”<br/>
            			11. I saw, and I heard something like a voice of many angels
            				around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders. The number of them was
            ten
            				thousands of ten thousands, and thousands of thousands;<br/>
            			12. saying with a loud voice, “Worthy is the Lamb who has been
            				killed to receive the power, wealth, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and
            				blessing!”<br/>
            			13. I heard every created thing which is in heaven, on the earth,
            				under the earth, on the sea, and everything in them, saying, “To him who sits on the
            				throne, and to the Lamb be the blessing, the honor, the glory, and the dominion,
            				forever and ever! Amen!”<br/>
            			14. The four living creatures said, “Amen!” Then the
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 6</h2>
         <p>
            			1. I saw that the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard
            				one of the four living creatures saying, as with a voice of thunder, “Come and
            				see!”<br/>
            			2. And behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it had a bow. A
            				crown was given to him, and he came out conquering, and to conquer.<br/>
            			3. When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living
            				creature saying, “Come!”<br/>
            			4. Another came out: a red horse. To him who sat on it was given
            				power to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another. There was
            				given to him a great sword.<br/>
            			5. When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature
            				saying, “Come and see!” And behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it had a
            				balance in his hand.<br/>
            			6. I heard a voice in the middle of the four living creatures
            				saying, “A choenix of wheat for a denarius, and three choenix of barley for a
            				denarius! Don’t damage the oil and the wine!”<br/>
            			7. When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living
            				creature saying, “Come and see!”<br/>
            			8. And behold, a pale horse, and the name of he who sat on it was
            				Death. Hades followed with him. Authority over one fourth of the earth, to kill
            with
            				the sword, with famine, with death, and by the wild animals of the earth was given
            				to him.<br/>
            			9. When he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the
            				souls of those who had been killed for the Word of God, and for the testimony of the
            				Lamb which they had.<br/>
            			10. They cried with a loud voice, saying, “How long, Master, the
            				holy and true, until you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the
            				earth?”<br/>
            			11. A long white robe was given to each of them. They were told
            				that they should rest yet for a while, until their fellow servants and their
            				brothers, who would also be killed even as they were, should complete their
            				course.<br/>
            			12. I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great
            				earthquake. The sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon
            				became as blood.<br/>
            			13. The stars of the sky fell to the earth, like a fig tree
            				dropping its unripe figs when it is shaken by a great wind.<br/>
            			14. The sky was removed like a scroll when it is rolled up. Every
            				mountain and island were moved out of their places.<br/>
            			15. The kings of the earth, the princes, the commanding officers,
            				the rich, the strong, and every slave and free person, hid themselves in the caves
            				and in the rocks of the mountains.<br/>
            			16. They told the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us, and hide
            				us from the face of him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb,<br/>
            			17. for the great day of his wrath has come; and who is able to
            				stand?”
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 7</h2>
         <p>
            			1. After this, I saw four angels standing at the four corners of
            				the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on
            the
            				earth, or on the sea, or on any tree.<br/>
            			2. I saw another angel ascend from the sunrise, having the seal of
            				the living God. He cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given
            				to harm the earth and the sea,<br/>
            			3. saying, “Don’t harm the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees,
            				until we have sealed the bondservants of our God on their foreheads!”<br/>
            			4. I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred
            				forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel:<br/>
            			5. of the tribe of Judah twelve thousand were sealed,of the tribe
            				of Reuben twelve thousand,of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand,<br/>
            			6. of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand,of the tribe of Naphtali
            				twelve thousand,of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand,<br/>
            			7. of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand,of the tribe of Levi
            				twelve thousand,of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand,<br/>
            			8. of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand,of the tribe of Joseph
            				twelve thousand, andof the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand were sealed.<br/>
            			9. After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude,
            				which no man could count, out of every nation and of all tribes, peoples, and
            				languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, dressed in white robes,
            				with palm branches in their hands.<br/>
            			10. They cried with a loud voice, saying, “Salvation be to our
            				God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!”<br/>
            			11. All the angels were standing around the throne, the elders,
            				and the four living creatures; and they fell on their faces before his throne,
            and
            				worshiped God,<br/>
            			12. saying, “Amen! Blessing, glory, wisdom, thanksgiving, honor,
            				power, and might, be to our God forever and ever! Amen.”<br/>
            			13. One of the elders answered, saying to me, “These who are
            				arrayed in the white robes, who are they, and where did they come from?”<br/>
            			14. I told him, “My lord, you know.”He said to me, “These are
            				those who came out of the great tribulation. They washed their robes, and made
            them
            				white in the Lamb’s blood.<br/>
            			15. Therefore they are before the throne of God, they serve him
            				day and night in his temple. He who sits on the throne will spread his tabernacle
            				over them.<br/>
            			16. They will never be hungry or thirsty any more. The sun won’t
            				beat on them, nor any heat;<br/>
            			17. for the Lamb who is in the middle of the throne shepherds them
            				and leads them to springs of life-giving waters. And God will wipe away every
            tear
            				from their eyes.”
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 8</h2>
         <p>
            			1. When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for
            				about half an hour.<br/>
            			2. I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets
            				were given to them.<br/>
            			3. Another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden
            				censer. Much incense was given to him, that he should add it to the prayers of
            all
            				the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.<br/>
            			4. The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went
            				up before God out of the angel’s hand.<br/>
            			5. The angel took the censer, and he filled it with the fire of the
            				altar, then threw it on the earth. Thunders, sounds, lightnings, and an earthquake
            				followed.<br/>
            			6. The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves
            				to sound.<br/>
            			7. The first sounded, and there followed hail and fire, mixed with
            				blood, and they were thrown to the earth. One third of the earth was burned up, and
            				one third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up.<br/>
            			8. The second angel sounded, and something like a great burning
            				mountain was thrown into the sea. One third of the sea became blood,<br/>
            			9. and one third of the living creatures which were in the sea
            				died. One third of the ships were destroyed.<br/>
            			10. The third angel sounded, and a great star fell from the sky,
            				burning like a torch, and it fell on one third of the rivers, and on the springs
            of
            				the waters.<br/>
            			11. The name of the star is called “Wormwood.” One third of the
            				waters became wormwood. Many people died from the waters, because they were made
            				bitter.<br/>
            			12. The fourth angel sounded, and one third of the sun was struck,
            				and one third of the moon, and one third of the stars; so that one third of them
            				would be darkened, and the day wouldn’t shine for one third of it, and the night
            in
            				the same way.<br/>
            			13. I saw, and I heard an eagle, flying in mid heaven, saying with
            				a loud voice, “Woe! Woe! Woe for those who dwell on the earth, because of the other
            				voices of the trumpets of the three angels, who are yet to sound!”
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 9</h2>
         <p>
            			1. The fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from the sky which had
            				fallen to the earth. The key to the pit of the abyss was given to him.<br/>
            			2. He opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke went up out of the
            				pit, like the smoke from a burning furnace. The sun and the air were darkened
            				because of the smoke from the pit.<br/>
            			3. Then out of the smoke came locusts on the earth, and power was
            				given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.<br/>
            			4. They were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth,
            				neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only those people who don’t have
            				God’s seal on their foreheads.<br/>
            			5. They were given power, not to kill them, but to torment them for
            				five months. Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes
            a
            				person.<br/>
            			6. In those days people will seek death, and will in no way find
            				it. They will desire to die, and death will flee from them.<br/>
            			7. The shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for war. On
            				their heads were something like golden crowns, and their faces were like people’s
            				faces.<br/>
            			8. They had hair like women’s hair, and their teeth were like those
            				of lions.<br/>
            			9. They had breastplates, like breastplates of iron. The sound of
            				their wings was like the sound of chariots, or of many horses rushing to war.<br/>
            			10. They have tails like those of scorpions, and stings. In their
            				tails they have power to harm men for five months.<br/>
            			11. They have over them as king the angel of the abyss. His name
            				in Hebrew is “Abaddon”, but in Greek, he has the name “Apollyon”. <br/>
            			12. The first woe is past. Behold, there are still two woes coming
            				after this.<br/>
            			13. The sixth angel sounded. I heard a voice from the horns of the
            				golden altar which is before God,<br/>
            			14. saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Free the four
            				angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates!”<br/>
            			15. The four angels were freed who had been prepared for that hour
            				and day and month and year, so that they might kill one third of mankind.<br/>
            			16. The number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred
            				million. I heard the number of them.<br/>
            			17. Thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those who sat on
            				them, having breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow; and
            the
            				horses’ heads resembled lions’ heads. Out of their mouths proceed fire, smoke,
            and
            				sulfur.<br/>
            			18. By these three plagues were one third of mankind killed: by
            				the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur, which proceeded out of their mouths.<br/>
            			19. For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their
            				tails. For their tails are like serpents, and have heads, and with them they
            				harm.<br/>
            			20. The rest of mankind, who were not killed with these plagues,
            				didn’t repent of the works of their hands, that they wouldn’t worship demons,
            and
            				the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood; which
            				can’t see, hear, or walk.<br/>
            			21. They didn’t repent of their murders, their sorceries, their
            				sexual immorality, or their thefts.

         <h2>Chapter: 10</h2>
         <p>
            			1. I saw a mighty angel coming down out of the sky, clothed with a
            				cloud. A rainbow was on his head. His face was like the sun, and his feet like
            				pillars of fire.<br/>
            			2. He had in his hand a little open book. He set his right foot on
            				the sea, and his left on the land.<br/>
            			3. He cried with a loud voice, as a lion roars. When he cried, the
            				seven thunders uttered their voices.<br/>
            			4. When the seven thunders sounded, I was about to write; but I
            				heard a voice from the sky saying, “Seal up the things which the seven thunders
            				said, and don’t write them.”<br/>
            			5. The angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted
            				up his right hand to the sky,<br/>
            			6. and swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven
            				and the things that are in it, the earth and the things that are in it, and the
            sea
            				and the things that are in it, that there will no longer be delay,<br/>
            			7. but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is
            				about to sound, then the mystery of God is finished, as he declared to his servants,
            				the prophets.<br/>
            			8. The voice which I heard from heaven, again speaking with me,
            				said, “Go, take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on
            the
            				sea and on the land.”<br/>
            			9. I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little book. He
            				said to me, “Take it, and eat it. It will make your stomach bitter, but in your
            				mouth it will be as sweet as honey.”<br/>
            			10. I took the little book out of the angel’s hand, and ate it.
            				It was as sweet as honey in my mouth. When I had eaten it, my stomach was made
            				bitter.<br/>
            			11. They told me, “You must prophesy again over many peoples,
            				nations, languages, and kings.”
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 11</h2>
         <p>
            			1. A reed like a rod was given to me. Someone said, “Rise, and
            				measure God’s temple, and the altar, and those who worship in it.<br/>
            			2. Leave out the court which is outside of the temple, and don’t
            				measure it, for it has been given to the nations. They will tread the holy city
            				under foot for forty-two months.<br/>
            			3. I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy
            				one thousand two hundred sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.”<br/>
            			4. These are the two olive trees and the two lamp stands, standing
            				before the Lord of the earth.<br/>
            			5. If anyone desires to harm them, fire proceeds out of their
            				mouth and devours their enemies. If anyone desires to harm them, he must be killed
            				in this way.<br/>
            			6. These have the power to shut up the sky, that it may not rain
            				during the days of their prophecy. They have power over the waters, to turn them
            				into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire.<br/>
            			7. When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes
            				up out of the abyss will make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them.<br/>
            			8. Their dead bodies will be in the street of the great city,
            				which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was
            				crucified.<br/>
            			9. From among the peoples, tribes, languages, and nations, people
            				will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days, and will not allow their
            				dead bodies to be laid in a tomb.<br/>
            			10. Those who dwell on the earth rejoice over them, and they will
            				be glad. They will give gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented
            				those who dwell on the earth.<br/>
            			11. After the three and a half days, the breath of life from God
            				entered into them, and they stood on their feet. Great fear fell on those who saw
            				them.<br/>
            			12. I heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up
            				here!” They went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies saw them.<br/>
            			13. In that day there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the
            				city fell. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were
            				terrified, and gave glory to the God of heaven.<br/>
            			14. The second woe is past. Behold, the third woe comes
            				quickly.<br/>
            			15. The seventh angel sounded, and great voices in heaven
            				followed, saying, “The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of our Lord,
            and
            				of his Christ. He will reign forever and ever!”<br/>
            			16. The twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before God’s
            				throne, fell on their faces and worshiped God,<br/>
            			17. saying: “We give you thanks, Lord God, the Almighty, the one
            				who is and who was; because you have taken your great power and reigned.<br/>
            			18. The nations were angry, and your wrath came, as did the time
            				for the dead to be judged, and to give your bondservants the prophets, their reward,
            				as well as to the saints, and those who fear your name, to the small and the great,
            				and to destroy those who destroy the earth.”<br/>
            			19. God’s temple that is in heaven was opened, and the ark of the
            				Lord’s covenant was seen in his temple. Lightnings, sounds, thunders, an earthquake,
            				and great hail followed.
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 12</h2>
         <p>
            			1. A great sign was seen in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun,
            				and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.<br/>
            			2. She was with child. She cried out in pain, laboring to give
            				birth.<br/>
            			3. Another sign was seen in heaven. Behold, a great red dragon,
            				having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven crowns.<br/>
            			4. His tail drew one third of the stars of the sky, and threw them
            				to the earth. The dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that
            				when she gave birth he might devour her child.<br/>
            			5. She gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the
            				nations with a rod of iron. Her child was caught up to God, and to his throne.<br/>
            			6. The woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place
            				prepared by God, that there they may nourish her one thousand two hundred sixty
            				days.<br/>
            			7. There was war in the sky. Michael and his angels made war on
            				the dragon. The dragon and his angels made war.<br/>
            			8. They didn’t prevail. No place was found for them any more in
            				heaven.<br/>
            			9. The great dragon was thrown down, the old serpent, he who is
            				called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world. He was thrown down
            to
            				the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.<br/>
            			10. I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, “Now the salvation,
            				the power, and the Kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ has come;
            for
            				the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accuses them before our
            God
            				day and night.<br/>
            			11. They overcame him because of the Lamb’s blood, and because of
            				the word of their testimony. They didn’t love their life, even to death.<br/>
            			12. Therefore rejoice, heavens, and you who dwell in them. Woe to
            				the earth and to the sea, because the devil has gone down to you, having great
            				wrath, knowing that he has but a short time.”<br/>
            			13. When the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth, he
            				persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child.<br/>
            			14. Two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, that
            				she might fly into the wilderness to her place, so that she might be nourished
            for a
            				time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.<br/>
            			15. The serpent spewed water out of his mouth after the woman
            				like a river, that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream.<br/>
            			16. The earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth
            				and swallowed up the river which the dragon spewed out of his mouth.<br/>
            			17. The dragon grew angry with the woman, and went away to make
            				war with the rest of her offspring, who keep God’s commandments and hold Jesus’
            				testimony.
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 13</h2>
         <p>
            			1. Then I stood on the sand of the sea. I saw a beast coming up
            				out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads. On his horns were ten crowns,
            and
            				on his heads, blasphemous names.<br/>
            			2. The beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were
            				like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave
            him
            				his power, his throne, and great authority.<br/>
            			3. One of his heads looked like it had been wounded fatally. His
            				fatal wound was healed, and the whole earth marveled at the beast.<br/>
            			4. They worshiped the dragon, because he gave his authority to the
            				beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast? Who is able to
            				make war with him?”<br/>
            			5. A mouth speaking great things and blasphemy was given to him.
            				Authority to make war for forty-two months was given to him.<br/>
            			6. He opened his mouth for blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his
            				name, and his dwelling, those who dwell in heaven.<br/>
            			7. It was given to him to make war with the saints, and to
            				overcome them. Authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation was given to
            				him.<br/>
            			8. All who dwell on the earth will worship him, everyone whose
            				name has not been written from the foundation of the world in the book of life
            of
            				the Lamb who has been killed.<br/>
            			9. If anyone has an ear, let him hear.<br/>
            			10. If anyone is to go into captivity, he will go into captivity.
            				If anyone is to be killed with the sword, he must be killed. Here is the endurance
            				and the faith of the saints.<br/>
            			11. I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. He had two
            				horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a dragon.<br/>
            			12. He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his
            				presence. He makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast,
            				whose fatal wound was healed.<br/>
            			13. He performs great signs, even making fire come down out of
            				the sky to the earth in the sight of people.<br/>
            			14. He deceives my own people who dwell on the earth because of
            				the signs he was granted to do in front of the beast, saying to those who dwell
            on
            				the earth that they should make an image to the beast who had the sword wound
            and
            				lived.<br/>
            			15. It was given to him to give breath to it, to the image of the
            				beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause as many as wouldn’t
            				worship the image of the beast to be killed.<br/>
            			16. He causes all, the small and the great, the rich and the
            				poor, and the free and the slave, to be given marks on their right hands, or on
            				their foreheads;<br/>
            			17. and that no one would be able to buy or to sell, unless he
            				has that mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name.<br/>
            			18. Here is wisdom. He who has understanding, let him calculate
            				the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. His number is six hundred
            				sixty-six.
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 14</h2>
         <p>
            			1. I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with
            				him a number, one hundred forty-four thousand, having his name, and the name of
            his
            				Father, written on their foreheads.<br/>
            			2. I heard a sound from heaven, like the sound of many waters, and
            				like the sound of a great thunder. The sound which I heard was like that of harpists
            				playing on their harps.<br/>
            			3. They sing a new song before the throne, and before the four
            				living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the one hundred
            				forty-four thousand, those who had been redeemed out of the earth.<br/>
            			4. These are those who were not defiled with women, for they are
            				virgins. These are those who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were redeemed
            				by Jesus from among men, the first fruits to God and to the Lamb.<br/>
            			5. In their mouth was found no lie, for they are blameless.<br/>
            			6. I saw an angel flying in mid heaven, having an eternal Good
            				News to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation, tribe,
            				language, and people.<br/>
            			7. He said with a loud voice, “Fear the Lord, and give him glory;
            				for the hour of his judgment has come. Worship him who made the heaven, the earth,
            				the sea, and the springs of waters!”<br/>
            			8. Another, a second angel, followed, saying, “Babylon the great
            				has fallen, which has made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her
            				sexual immorality.”<br/>
            			9. Another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great
            				voice, “If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his
            				forehead, or on his hand,<br/>
            			10. he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is
            				prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger. He will be tormented with fire and sulfur
            				in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.<br/>
            			11. The smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever. They
            				have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever
            				receives the mark of his name.<br/>
            			12. Here is the perseverance of the saints, those who keep the
            				commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”<br/>
            			13. I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write, ‘Blessed are the
            				dead who die in the Lord from now on.’”“Yes,” says the Spirit, “that they may rest
            				from their labors; for their works follow with them.”<br/>
            			14. I looked, and saw a white cloud, and on the cloud one sitting
            				like a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp
            				sickle.<br/>
            			15. Another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud
            				voice to him who sat on the cloud, “Send your sickle, and reap; for the hour to
            reap
            				has come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe!”<br/>
            			16. He who sat on the cloud thrust his sickle on the earth, and
            				the earth was reaped.<br/>
            			17. Another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven. He
            				also had a sharp sickle.<br/>
            			18. Another angel came out from the altar, he who has power over
            				fire, and he called with a great voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying,
            				“Send your sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for
            the
            				earth’s grapes are fully ripe!”<br/>
            			19. The angel thrust his sickle into the earth, and gathered the
            				vintage of the earth, and threw it into the great wine press of the wrath of
            				God.<br/>
            			20. The wine press was trodden outside of the city, and blood
            				came out of the wine press, even to the bridles of the horses, as far as one
            				thousand six hundred stadia.
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 15</h2>
         <p>
            			1. I saw another great and marvelous sign in the sky: seven angels
            				having the seven last plagues, for in them God’s wrath is finished.<br/>
            			2. I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those
            				who overcame the beast, his image, and the number of his name, standing on the
            sea
            				of glass, having harps of God.<br/>
            			3. They sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song
            				of the Lamb, saying,“Great and marvelous are your works, Lord God, the
            				Almighty!Righteous and true are your ways, you King of the nations.<br/>
            			4. Who wouldn’t fear you, Lord,and glorify your name?For you only
            				are holy. For all the nations will come and worship before you. For your righteous
            				acts have been revealed.”<br/>
            			5. After these things I looked, and the temple of the tabernacle
            				of the testimony in heaven was opened.<br/>
            			6. The seven angels who had the seven plagues came out, clothed
            				with pure, bright linen, and wearing golden sashes around their breasts.<br/>
            			7. One of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven
            				golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.<br/>
            			8. The temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and
            				from his power. No one was able to enter into the temple until the seven plagues
            of
            				the seven angels would be finished.

         <h2>Chapter: 16</h2>
         <p>
            			1. I heard a loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven
            				angels, “Go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God on the earth!”<br/>
            			2. The first went, and poured out his bowl into the earth, and it
            				became a harmful and evil sore on the people who had the mark of the beast, and who
            				worshiped his image.<br/>
            			3. The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it
            				became blood as of a dead man. Every living thing in the sea died.<br/>
            			4. The third poured out his bowl into the rivers and springs of
            				water, and they became blood.<br/>
            			5. I heard the angel of the waters saying, “You are righteous, who
            				are and who were, O Holy One, because you have judged these things.<br/>
            			6. For they poured out the blood of saints and prophets, and you
            				have given them blood to drink. They deserve this.”<br/>
            			7. I heard the altar saying, “Yes, Lord God, the Almighty, true
            				and righteous are your judgments.”<br/>
            			8. The fourth poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was given to
            				him to scorch men with fire.<br/>
            			9.  People were scorched with great heat, and people blasphemed the
            				name of God who has the power over these plagues. They didn’t repent and give him
            				glory.<br/>
            			10. The fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and
            				his kingdom was darkened. They gnawed their tongues because of the pain,<br/>
            			11. and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains
            				and their sores. They didn’t repent of their works.<br/>
            			12. The sixth poured out his bowl on the great river, the
            				Euphrates. Its water was dried up, that the way might be prepared for the kings
            that
            				come from the sunrise.<br/>
            			13. I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the
            				mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean
            				spirits, something like frogs;<br/>
            			14. for they are spirits of demons, performing signs; which go
            				out to the kings of the whole inhabited earth, to gather them together for the
            war
            				of that great day of God, the Almighty.<br/>
            			15. “Behold, I come like a thief. Blessed is he who watches, and
            				keeps his clothes, so that he doesn’t walk naked, and they see his shame.”<br/>
            			16. He gathered them together into the place which is called in
            				Hebrew, “Megiddo”.<br/>
            			17. The seventh poured out his bowl into the air. A loud voice
            				came out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, “It is done!”<br/>
            			18. There were lightnings, sounds, and thunders; and there was a
            				great earthquake, such as has not happened since there were men on the earth,
            so
            				great an earthquake, and so mighty.<br/>
            			19. The great city was divided into three parts, and the cities
            				of the nations fell. Babylon the great was remembered in the sight of God, to
            give
            				to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.<br/>
            			20. Every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.<br/>
            			21. Great hailstones, about the weight of a talent, came down out
            				of the sky on people. People blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail,
            for
            				this plague is exceedingly severe.
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 17</h2>
         <p>
            			1. One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke
            				with me, saying, “Come here. I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute
            				who sits on many waters,<br/>
            			2. with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality.
            				Those who dwell in the earth were made drunken with the wine of her sexual
            				immorality.”<br/>
            			3. He carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. I saw a
            				woman sitting on a scarlet-colored beast, full of blasphemous names, having seven
            				heads and ten horns.<br/>
            			4. The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and decked with
            				gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of
            				abominations and the impurities of the sexual immorality of the earth.<br/>
            			5. And on her forehead a name was written, “MYSTERY, BABYLON THE
            				GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.”<br/>
            			6. I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with
            				the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. When I saw her, I wondered with great
            				amazement.<br/>
            			7. The angel said to me, “Why do you wonder? I will tell you the
            				mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads
            				and the ten horns.<br/>
            			8. The beast that you saw was, and is not; and is about to come up
            				out of the abyss and to go into destruction. Those who dwell on the earth and whose
            				names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world
            				will marvel when they see that the beast was, and is not, and shall be present.<br/>
            			9. Here is the mind that has wisdom. The seven heads are seven
            				mountains on which the woman sits.<br/>
            			10. They are seven kings. Five have fallen, the one is, the other
            				has not yet come. When he comes, he must continue a little while.<br/>
            			11. The beast that was, and is not, is himself also an eighth,
            				and is of the seven; and he goes to destruction.<br/>
            			12. The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have received no
            				kingdom as yet, but they receive authority as kings with the beast for one hour.<br/>
            			13. These have one mind, and they give their power and authority
            				to the beast.<br/>
            			14. These will war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome
            				them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings, and those who are with him are
            				called chosen and faithful.”<br/>
            			15. He said to me, “The waters which you saw, where the
            				prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.<br/>
            			16. The ten horns which you saw, and the beast, these will hate
            				the prostitute, will make her desolate, will strip her naked, will eat her flesh,
            				and will burn her utterly with fire.<br/>
            			17. For God has put in their hearts to do what he has in mind, to
            				be of one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God
            				should be accomplished.<br/>
            			18. The woman whom you saw is the great city, which reigns over
            				the kings of the earth.”
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 18</h2>
         <p>
            			1. After these things, I saw another angel coming down out of the
            				sky, having great authority. The earth was illuminated with his glory.<br/>
            			2. He cried with a mighty voice, saying, “Fallen, fallen is
            				Babylon the great, and she has become a habitation of demons, a prison of every
            				unclean spirit, and a prison of every unclean and hateful bird!<br/>
            			3. For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her
            				sexual immorality, the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her,
            and
            				the merchants of the earth grew rich from the abundance of her luxury.”<br/>
            			4. I heard another voice from heaven, saying, “Come out of her, my
            				people, that you have no participation in her sins, and that you don’t receive
            of
            				her plagues,<br/>
            			5. for her sins have reached to the sky, and God has remembered
            				her iniquities.<br/>
            			6. Return to her just as she returned, and repay her double as she
            				did, and according to her works. In the cup which she mixed, mix to her double.<br/>
            			7. However much she glorified herself, and grew wanton, so much
            				give her of torment and mourning. For she says in her heart, ‘I sit a queen, and am
            				no widow, and will in no way see mourning.’<br/>
            			8. Therefore in one day her plagues will come: death, mourning,
            				and famine; and she will be utterly burned with fire; for the Lord God who has
            				judged her is strong.<br/>
            			9. The kings of the earth who committed sexual immorality and
            				lived wantonly with her will weep and wail over her, when they look at the smoke of
            				her burning,<br/>
            			10. standing far away for the fear of her torment, saying, ‘Woe,
            				woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city! For your judgment has come in one
            				hour.’<br/>
            			11. The merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, for no
            				one buys their merchandise any more:<br/>
            			12. merchandise of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, fine
            				linen, purple, silk, scarlet, all expensive wood, every vessel of ivory, every
            				vessel made of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble;<br/>
            			13. and cinnamon, incense, perfume, frankincense, wine, olive
            				oil, fine flour, wheat, sheep, horses, chariots, and people’s bodies and souls.<br/>
            			14. The fruits which your soul lusted after have been lost to
            				you. All things that were dainty and sumptuous have perished from you, and you
            will
            				find them no more at all.<br/>
            			15. The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her,
            				will stand far away for the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,<br/>
            			16. saying, ‘Woe, woe, the great city, she who was dressed in
            				fine linen, purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and
            				pearls!<br/>
            			17. For in an hour such great riches are made desolate.’ Every
            				ship master, and everyone who sails anywhere, and mariners, and as many as gain
            				their living by sea, stood far away,<br/>
            			18. and cried out as they looked at the smoke of her burning,
            				saying, ‘What is like the great city?’<br/>
            			19. They cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and
            				mourning, saying, ‘Woe, woe, the great city, in which all who had their ships
            in the
            				sea were made rich by reason of her great wealth!’ For she is made desolate in
            one
            				hour.<br/>
            			20. “Rejoice over her, O heaven, you saints, apostles, and
            				prophets; for God has judged your judgment on her.”<br/>
            			21. A mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and
            				cast it into the sea, saying, “Thus with violence will Babylon, the great city,
            be
            				thrown down, and will be found no more at all.<br/>
            			22. The voice of harpists, minstrels, flute players, and
            				trumpeters will be heard no more at all in you. No craftsman, of whatever craft,
            				will be found any more at all in you. The sound of a mill will be heard no more
            at
            				all in you.<br/>
            			23. The light of a lamp will shine no more at all in you. The
            				voice of the bridegroom and of the bride will be heard no more at all in you;
            for
            				your merchants were the princes of the earth; for with your sorcery all the nations
            				were deceived.<br/>
            			24. In her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of
            				all who have been slain on the earth.”
            		</p>
         <h2>Chapter: 19</h2>
         <p>
            			1. After these things I heard something like a loud voice of a
            				great multitude in heaven, saying, “Hallelujah! Salvation, power, and glory belong
            				to our God;<br/>
            			2. for his judgments are true and righteous. For he has judged the
            				great prostitute, who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality, and he has
            				avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.”<br/>
            			3. A second said, “Hallelujah! Her smoke goes up forever and
            				ever.”<br/>
            			4. The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down
            				and worshiped God who sits on the throne, saying, “Amen! Hallelujah!”<br/>
            			5. A voice came from the throne, saying, “Give praise to our God,
            				all you his servants, you who fear him, the small and the great!”<br/>
            			6. I heard something like the voice of a great multitude, and like
            				the voice of many waters, and like the voice of mighty thunders, saying,
            				“Hallelujah! For the Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns!<br/>
            			7.  Let’s rejoice and be exceedingly glad, and let’s give the glory
            				to him. For the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his wife has made herself
            				ready.”<br/>
            			8. It was given to her that she would array herself in bright,
            				pure, fine linen: for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.<br/>
            			9. He said to me, “Write, ‘Blessed are those who are invited to
            				the marriage supper of the Lamb.’” He said to me, “These are true words of God.”<br/>
            			10. I fell down before his feet to worship him. He said to me,
            				“Look! Don’t do it! I am a fellow bondservant with you and with your brothers
            who
            				hold the testimony of Jesus. Worship God, for the testimony of Jesus is the Spirit
            				of Prophecy.”<br/>
            			11. I saw the heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and he
            				who sat on it is called Faithful and True. In righteousness he judges and makes
            				war.<br/>
            			12. His eyes are a flame of fire, and on his head are many
            				crowns. He has names written and a name written which no one knows but he
            				himself.<br/>
            			13. He is clothed in a garment sprinkled with blood. His name is
            				called “The Word of God.”<br/>
            			14. The armies which are in heaven followed him on white horses,
            				clothed in white, pure, fine linen.<br/>
            			15. Out of his mouth proceeds a sharp, double-edged sword, that
            				with it he should strike the nations. He will rule them with an iron rod. He treads
            				the wine press of the fierceness of the wrath of God, the Almighty.<br/>
            			16. He has on his garment and on his thigh a name written, “KING
            				OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.”<br/>
            			17. I saw an angel standing in the sun. He cried with a loud
            				voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the sky, “Come! Be gathered together
            to
            				the great supper of God,<br/>
            			18. that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains,
            				the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of those who sit on them,
            and
            				the flesh of all men, both free and slave, small and great.”<br/>
            			19. I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their
            				armies, gathered together to make war against him who sat on the horse, and against
            				his army.<br/>
            			20. The beast was taken, and with him the false prophet who
            				worked the signs in his sight, with which he deceived those who had received the
            				mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image. These two were thrown alive
            				into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.<br/>
            			21. The rest were killed with the sword of him who sat on the
            				horse, the sword which came out of his mouth. All the birds were filled with their
            				flesh.

         <h2>Chapter: 20</h2>
         <p>
            			1. I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the
            				abyss and a great chain in his hand.<br/>
            			2. He seized the dragon, the old serpent, which is the devil and
            				Satan, who deceives the whole inhabited earth, and bound him for a thousand
            				years,<br/>
            			3. and cast him into the abyss, and shut it, and sealed it over
            				him, that he should deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years were
            				finished. After this, he must be freed for a short time.<br/>
            			4. I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to
            				them. I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus,
            and
            				for the word of God, and such as didn’t worship the beast nor his image, and didn’t
            				receive the mark on their forehead and on their hand. They lived and reigned with
            				Christ for a thousand years.<br/>
            			5. The rest of the dead didn’t live until the thousand years were
            				finished. This is the first resurrection.<br/>
            			6. Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection.
            				Over these, the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and
            of
            				Christ, and will reign with him one thousand years.<br/>
            			7. And after the thousand years, Satan will be released from his
            				prison,<br/>
            			8. and he will come out to deceive the nations which are in the
            				four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the war; the
            				number of whom is as the sand of the sea.<br/>
            			9. They went up over the width of the earth, and surrounded the
            				camp of the saints, and the beloved city. Fire came down out of heaven from God and
            				devoured them.<br/>
            			10. The devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire
            				and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet are also. They will be tormented
            				day and night forever and ever.<br/>
            			11. I saw a great white throne, and him who sat on it, from whose
            				face the earth and the heaven fled away. There was found no place for them.<br/>
            			12. I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the
            				throne, and they opened books. Another book was opened, which is the book of life.
            				The dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books, according
            to
            				their works.<br/>
            			13. The sea gave up the dead who were in it. Death and Hades gave
            				up the dead who were in them. They were judged, each one according to his works.<br/>
            			14. Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is
            				the second death, the lake of fire.<br/>
            			15. If anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was
            				cast into the lake of fire.

         <h2>Chapter: 21</h2>
         <p>
            			1. I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and
            				the first earth have passed away, and the sea is no more.<br/>
            			2. I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven
            				from God, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband.<br/>
            			3. I heard a loud voice out of heaven saying, “Behold, God’s
            				dwelling is with people, and he will dwell with them, and they will be his people,
            				and God himself will be with them as their God.<br/>
            			4. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. Death will be no
            				more; neither will there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain, any more. The first
            				things have passed away.”<br/>
            			5. He who sits on the throne said,“Behold, I am making all things
            				new.”He said,“Write, for these words of God are faithful and true.”<br/>
            			6. He said to me,“I have become the Alpha and the Omega, the
            				Beginning and the End. “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning
            and
            				the End. I will give freely to him who is thirsty from the spring of the water
            of
            				life.<br/>
            			7. He who overcomes, I will give him these things. I will be his
            				God, and he will be my son.<br/>
            			8. But for the cowardly, unbelieving, sinners, abominable,
            				murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their part is
            in
            				the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”<br/>
            			9. One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, who were
            				loaded with the seven last plagues came, and he spoke with me, saying, “Come here.
            I
            				will show you the wife, the Lamb’s bride.”<br/>
            			10. He carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high
            				mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from
            				God,<br/>
            			11. having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious
            				stone, as if it were a jasper stone, clear as crystal;<br/>
            			12. having a great and high wall; having twelve gates, and at the
            				gates twelve angels; and names written on them, which are the names of the twelve
            				tribes of the children of Israel.<br/>
            			13. On the east were three gates; and on the north three gates;
            				and on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.<br/>
            			14. The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them
            				twelve names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb.<br/>
            			15. He who spoke with me had for a measure a golden reed to
            				measure the city, its gates, and its walls.<br/>
            			16. The city is square, and its length is as great as its width.
            				He measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand twelve stadia. Its length,
            				width, and height are equal.<br/>
            			17. Its wall is one hundred forty-four cubits, by the measure of
            				a man, that is, of an angel.<br/>
            			18. The construction of its wall was jasper. The city was pure
            				gold, like pure glass.<br/>
            			19. The foundations of the city’s wall were adorned with all
            				kinds of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire;
            the
            				third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;<br/>
            			20. the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh,
            				chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus; the
            				eleventh, jacinth; and the twelfth, amethyst.<br/>
            			21. The twelve gates were twelve pearls. Each one of the gates
            				was made of one pearl. The street of the city was pure gold, like transparent
            				glass.<br/>
            			22. I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God, the Almighty, and
            				the Lamb, are its temple.<br/>
            			23. The city has no need for the sun or moon to shine, for the
            				very glory of God illuminated it, and its lamp is the Lamb.<br/>
            			24. The nations will walk in its light. The kings of the earth
            				bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.<br/>
            			25. Its gates will in no way be shut by day (for there will be no
            				night there),<br/>
            			26. and they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations
            				into it so that they may enter.<br/>
            			27. There will in no way enter into it anything profane, or one
            				who causes an abomination or a lie, but only those who are written in the Lamb’s
            				book of life.

         <h2>Chapter: 22</h2>
         <p>
            			1. He showed me a river of water of life, clear as crystal,
            				proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb,<br/>
            			2. in the middle of its street. On this side of the river and on
            				that was the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruits, yielding its fruit
            every
            				month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.<br/>
            			3. There will be no curse any more. The throne of God and of the
            				Lamb will be in it, and his servants will serve him.<br/>
            			4. They will see his face, and his name will be on their
            				foreheads.<br/>
            			5. There will be no night, and they need no lamp light or sun
            				light; for the Lord God will illuminate them. They will reign forever and ever.<br/>
            			6. He said to me, “These words are faithful and true. The Lord God
            				of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to show to his bondservants the
            things
            				which must happen soon.”<br/>
            			7. “Behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he who keeps the words of
            				the prophecy of this book.”<br/>
            			8. Now I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. When I
            				heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who had shown
            me
            				these things.<br/>
            			9. He said to me, “See you don’t do it! I am a fellow bondservant
            				with you and with your brothers, the prophets, and with those who keep the words
            of
            				this book. Worship God.”<br/>
            			10. He said to me, “Don’t seal up the words of the prophecy of
            				this book, for the time is at hand.<br/>
            			11. He who acts unjustly, let him act unjustly still. He who is
            				filthy, let him be filthy still. He who is righteous, let him do righteousness
            				still. He who is holy, let him be holy still.”<br/>
            			12. “Behold, I come quickly. My reward is with me, to repay to
            				each man according to his work.<br/>
            			13. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the
            				Beginning and the End.<br/>
            			14. Blessed are those who do his commandments,that they may have
            				the right to the tree of life, and may enter in by the gates into the city.<br/>
            			15. Outside are the dogs, the sorcerers, the sexually immoral,
            				the murderers, the idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.<br/>
            			16. I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify these things to you
            				for the assemblies. I am the root and the offspring of David, the Bright and Morning
            				Star.”<br/>
            			17. The Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” He who hears, let him
            				say, “Come!” He who is thirsty, let him come. He who desires, let him take the
            water
            				of life freely.<br/>
            			18. I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of
            				this book, if anyone adds to them, may God add to him the plagues which are written
            				in this book.<br/>
            			19. If anyone takes away from the words of the book of this
            				prophecy, may God take away his part from the tree of life, and out of the holy
            				city, which are written in this book.<br/>
            			20. He who testifies these things says,“Yes, I come
            				quickly.”Amen! Yes, come, Lord Jesus.<br/>
            			21. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with all the saints.
            				Amen.
