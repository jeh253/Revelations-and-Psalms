# Updated Methodology

Our methodology involves tags with both elements and attributes, if you would like a more explicit understanding of what specifically we chose to tag and why, you can refer to our markup guidelines here on our GitHub. We will be tagging words and phrases seen throughout the books of Revelations and Psalms in the Bible. The phrases and words that will be tagged will be specific to those that deal with emotional language. 

An example of this would be something like the phrase, "God, you have rejected us." This phrase would be tagged like so: `God, <emo_lang emotion="sorrow" tone="fear">you have rejected us</emo_lang>.`

# The Specifics

TAGGING:
Includes the use of both attributes and elements; tagging both phrases and words

Tags: 
- emotions: `emo_lang`

Attributes: 
- specific emotion (listed below)
- there can be more than one attribute to an emotion, which is not always the case but in a minority of tags will still be seen

  Emotions: Emotions are attributed based on whether or not the word or phrase reads as emotional language to the (human) tagger. It is important to note that since the tagging is being done by three separate individuals there will be slight variations of what is considered emotional language.
  
  The emotions that are listed as attributes are: 
  - joy
  - sorrow
  - anger
  - contentment
  - fear

  Tone: Tone is attributed based on the way that the emotional phrase is being considered within it's context. Tone has more than one option but are attributed within the same attribute, in the event that an emotional word or phrase may be considered to fall under two of the following. It is important to note that since the tagging is being done by three separate individuals there will be slight variations of what tone is attributed to each tag with emotional language.
  
  The tones that are listed as attributes are:
  - Pleading
  - Petitioning
  - Violence
  - Boasting
  - Anxiety
  - Praise
  - Fear
