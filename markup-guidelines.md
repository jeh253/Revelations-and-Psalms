# Mark-up Guidelines:
-  Text is marked for one emotion and multiple possible tones
-  Multiple tones may be used if the person marking-up the text feels that the selected passage requires it
-  Emotions and tones are determined based on context as well as the language used (i.e. in cases where the word “praise!” Appears, it can be inferred that the tone will be that of “praise”)
-  Definitions of each emotion and tone are standardized between group members by referring to the given definition for each term in the Merriam-Webster online dictionary
-  While these definitions are standard, ultimately the passages are being marked by humans for emotions. Thus in a further effort to achieve consistency, each group member has checked through another member’s section
