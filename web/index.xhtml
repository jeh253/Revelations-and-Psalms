            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This project analyzes and categorizes the emotional language in the Bibical books of
                Psalms and Revelations. The types of emotional language present in both of these
                books are then compared in order to assess the difference in tone between the Old
                and New Testaments.</p>
            <p>Our research questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is the emotional tone and language of the book of Psalms and the book of
                    Revelations?</li>
                <li>Is there any variation from the Old Testament to the New Testament?</li>
            </ul>
