               individual tone or emotion, or you can combine them to see where they
               overlap! If you would like to look at one specific book in particular,
               check the box specified “Psalms” or “Revelations”. If you would like to
               look at the corpus as a whole, check the box labeled “All”. Emotions and
               tones can be checked independently of each other, but for best results,
               they should be checked together. Once checked, emotions will show up as
               color coded text, and tones will be underlined with color. </p>

                  			12. I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. Having turned, I
                  				saw seven golden lamp stands.<br/>
                  			13. And among the lamp stands was one like a son of man, clothed
                  				with a robe reaching down to his feet, and with a golden sash around his chest.<br/>
                  			14. His head and his hair were white as white wool, like snow. His
                  				eyes were like a flame of fire.<br/>
                  			15. His feet were like burnished brass, as if it had been refined
                  				in a furnace. His voice was like the voice of many waters.<br/>
                  			16. He had seven stars in his right hand. <span class="anger violence"></span> His face was like the sun shining at its brightest.<br/>
                  			17. When I saw him, <span class="? praise"></span> He laid his right hand on me,
                  					saying,“<span class="contentment petitioning"></span> I am the first and the last,<br/>
                  			18. and the Living one. I was dead, and behold, I am alive forever
                  				and ever. Amen. I have the keys of Death and of Hades.<br/>
                  			19. Write therefore the things which you have seen, and the things
                  				which are, and the things which will happen hereafter.<br/>
                  			20. The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand,
                  				and the seven golden lamp stands is this: The seven stars are the angelsof the

                  				were given to them.<br/>
                  			3. Another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden
                  				censer. Much incense was given to him, that he should add it to the prayers of
                  all
                  				the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.<br/>
                  			4. The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went
                  				up before God out of the angel’s hand.<br/>
                  			5. The angel took the censer, and he filled it with the fire of the
                  				altar, then threw it on the earth. <span class="anger violence"></span><br/>
                  			6. The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves
                  				to sound.<br/>
                  			7. The first sounded, and <span class="anger violence"></span>, and they were thrown to the earth. <span class="anger violence"></span><br/>
                  			8. The second angel sounded, and <span class="anger violence"></span><br/>
                  			9. and <span class="anger violence"></span><br/>
                  			10. The third angel sounded, and a great star fell from the sky,
                  				burning like a torch, and it fell on one third of the rivers, and on the springs
                  of
                  				the waters.<br/>
                  			11. The name of the star is called “Wormwood.” One third of the
                  				waters became wormwood. <span class="anger violence"></span>, because they were made
                  				bitter.<br/>
                  			12. The fourth angel sounded, and <span class="anger violence"></span>; so that one third of them
                  				would be darkened, and the day wouldn’t shine for one third of it, and the night
                  in
                  				the same way.<br/>
                  			13. I saw, and I heard an eagle, flying in mid heaven, saying with
                  				a loud voice, “<span class="sorrow fear"></span> because of the other
                  				voices of the trumpets of the three angels, who are yet to sound!”

                  				fallen to the earth. The key to the pit of the abyss was given to him.<br/>

                  				because of the smoke from the pit.<br/>
                  			3. Then out of the smoke came locusts on the earth, and power was

                  			4. <span class="anger violence"></span><br/>

                  			7. The shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for war. On

                  				faces.<br/>

                  				of lions.<br/>
                  			9. They had breastplates, like breastplates of iron. The sound of
                  				their wings was like the sound of chariots, or of many horses rushing to war.<br/>
                  			10. They have tails like those of scorpions, and stings. In their
                  				tails <span class="anger violence"></span><br/>
                  			11. They have over them as king the angel of the abyss. His name
                  				in Hebrew is “Abaddon”, but in Greek, he has the name “Apollyon”. <br/>
                  			12. The first woe is past. Behold, <span class="sorrow violence"></span><br/>
                  			13. The sixth angel sounded. I heard a voice from the horns of the

                  			15. The four angels were freed who had been prepared for that hour

                  			16. The number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred
                  				million. I heard the number of them.<br/>
                  			17. Thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those who sat on
                  				them, having breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow; and
                  the

                  				pillars of fire.<br/>
                  			2. He had in his hand a little open book. He set his right foot on

                  			8. The voice which I heard from heaven, again speaking with me,
                  				said, “Go, take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on

                  			9. I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little book. He

                  				<span class="sorrow violence"></span> Here is the endurance
                  				and the faith of the saints.<br/>
                  			11. I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. He had two
                  				horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a dragon.<br/>
                  			12. He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his
                  				presence. He makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast,
                  				whose fatal wound was healed.<br/>
                  			13. <span class="joy praise"></span> even making fire come down out of
                  				the sky to the earth in the sight of people.<br/>
                  			14. <span class="anger righteousness"></span> who dwell on the earth because of
                  				the signs he was granted to do in front of the beast, saying to those who dwell
                  on
                  				the earth that they should make an image to the beast who had the sword wound
                  and
                  				lived.<br/>
                  			15. It was given to him to give breath to it, to the image of the
                  				beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and <span class="anger violence"></span><br/>
                  			16. He causes all, the small and the great, the rich and the
                  				poor, and the free and the slave, to be given marks on their right hands, or on
                  				their foreheads;<br/>
                  			17. and that no one would be able to buy or to sell, unless he
                  				has that mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name.<br/>
                  			18. Here is wisdom. He who has understanding, let him calculate
                  				the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. His number is six hundred
                  				sixty-six.

                  				like the sound of a great thunder. The sound which I heard was like that of harpists
                  				playing on their harps.<br/>
                  			3. They sing a new song before the throne, and before the four

                  				forty-four thousand, those who had been redeemed out of the earth.<br/>
                  			4. These are those who were not defiled with women, for they are
                  				virgins. These are those who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were redeemed
                  				by Jesus from among men, the first fruits to God and to the Lamb.<br/>
                  			5. <span class="joy praise"></span><br/>
                  			6. I saw an angel flying in mid heaven, having an eternal Good
                  				News to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation, tribe,
                  				language, and people.<br/>
                  			7. He said with a loud voice, “<span class="fear? petitioning"></span>;

                  				the sea, and the springs of waters!”<br/>
                  			8. Another, a second angel, followed, saying, “Babylon the great

                  			9. Another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great

                  				in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.<br/>
                  			11. <span class="anger violence"></span> They
                  				have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever
                  				receives the mark of his name.<br/>
                  			12. Here is the perseverance of the saints, those who keep the
                  				commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.”<br/>
                  			13. I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write, ‘<span class="joy praise"></span> from now on.’”“Yes,” says the Spirit, “that they may rest
                  				from their labors; for their works follow with them.”<br/>
                  			14. I looked, and saw a white cloud, and on the cloud one sitting
                  				like a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp
                  				sickle.<br/>
                  			15. Another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud

                  			16. He who sat on the cloud thrust his sickle on the earth, and
                  				the earth was reaped.<br/>
                  			17. Another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven. He
                  				also had a sharp sickle.<br/>

                  			8. The temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and

                  of

                  				spirits, something like frogs;<br/>

                  				Hebrew, “Megiddo”.<br/>
                  			17. The seventh poured out his bowl into the air. A loud voice

                  so
                  				great an earthquake, and so mighty.<br/>
                  			19. The great city was divided into three parts, and the cities
                  				of the nations fell. Babylon the great was remembered in the sight of God, to

                  				heads and ten horns.<br/>
                  			4. The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and decked with
                  				gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand <span class="anger righteousness"></span><br/>
                  			5. And on her forehead a name was written, “MYSTERY, BABYLON THE
                  				GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.”<br/>
                  			6. I saw <span class="sorrow violence"></span> When I saw her, I wondered with great
                  				amazement.<br/>
                  			7. The angel said to me, “Why do you wonder? I will tell you the
                  				mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads
                  				and the ten horns.<br/>
                  			8. The beast that you saw was, and is not; and <span class="anger violence"></span> Those who dwell on the earth and whose
                  				names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world
                  				will marvel when they see that the beast was, and is not, and shall be present.<br/>
                  			9. Here is the mind that has wisdom. The seven heads are seven
                  				mountains on which the woman sits.<br/>
                  			10. They are seven kings. Five have fallen, the one is, the other
                  				has not yet come. When he comes, he must continue a little while.<br/>
                  			11. The beast that was, and is not, is himself also an eighth,
                  				and is of the seven; and <span class="anger violence"></span><br/>
                  			12. The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have received no
                  				kingdom as yet, but they receive authority as kings with the beast for one hour.<br/>
                  			13. These have one mind, and they give their power and authority
                  				to the beast.<br/>
                  			14. <span class="anger violence"></span>, and the Lamb will overcome
                  				them, <span class="joy praise"></span>”<br/>
                  			15. He said to me, “The waters which you saw, where the
                  				prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.<br/>
                  			16. The ten horns which you saw, and the beast, <span class="anger violence"></span><br/>
                  			17. For God has put in their hearts to do what he has in mind, to

                  				should be accomplished.<br/>

                  			2. for his judgments are true and righteous. For he has judged the

                  			4. The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down
                  				and worshiped God who sits on the throne, saying, “<span class="joy praise"></span>”<br/>
                  			5. A voice came from the throne, saying, “<span class="joy praise"></span>”<br/>
                  			6. I heard something like the voice of a great multitude, and like
                  				the voice of many waters, and like the voice of mighty thunders, saying,
                  				“<span class="joy praise"></span><br/>
                  			7.  Let’s rejoice and be exceedingly glad, and let’s give the glory

                  				ready.”<br/>
                  			8. It was given to her that she would array herself in bright,
                  				pure, fine linen: for the fine linen is <span class="joy righteousness"></span><br/>
                  			9. He said to me, “Write, ‘<span class="joy praise"></span>’” He said to me, “These are true words of God.”<br/>
                  			10. I fell down before his feet to worship him. He said to me,
                  				“Look! Don’t do it! I am a fellow bondservant with you and with your brothers

                  			12. His eyes are a flame of fire, and on his head are many

                  				himself.<br/>

                  				called “The Word of God.”<br/>
                  			14. The armies which are in heaven followed him on white horses,
                  				clothed in white, pure, fine linen.<br/>
                  			15. <span class="anger violence righteousness"></span><br/>
                  			16. He has on his garment and on his thigh a name written, “KING
                  				OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.”<br/>
                  			17. I saw an angel standing in the sun. He cried with a loud
                  				voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the sky, “Come! Be gathered together
                  to

                  				his army.<br/>

                  			4. I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to

                  				The dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books, according

                  			14. The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them
                  				twelve names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb.<br/>
