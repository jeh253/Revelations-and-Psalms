                <h2>Old and New Testament</h2>
                <p>This project utilizes one book from the Old Testament and one book from
                    the New Testament. The Old Testament consists of the first 46 books of
                    the Christian Bible. This project uses Psalms which is a book of hymns
                    and laments to God. The New Testament consists of 27 books and is the
                    second half of the Christian Bible. This project uses the Book of
                    Revelation, which is the final book of the New Testament. It outlines an
                    apocalyptic prophecy.</p>
                <h3>Methodology</h3>
                <p>Our methodology involves tags with both elements and attributes, if you
                    would like a more explicit understanding of what specifically we chose
                    to tag and why, you can refer to our markup guidelines on our GitHub. We
                    will be tagging words and phrases seen throughout the books of
                    Revelations and Psalms in the Bible. The phrases and words that will be
                    tagged will be specific to those that deal with emotional language. An
                    example of this would be something like the phrase, "God, you have
                    rejected us." </p>
                <p>The emotions that are listed as attributes are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>joy</li>
                    <li>sorrow</li>
                    <li>anger</li>
                    <li>contentment</li>
                    <li>fear</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The tones that are listed as attributes are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>pleading</li>
                    <li>petitioning</li>
                    <li>violence</li>
                    <li>boasting</li>
                    <li>anxiety</li>
                    <li>praise</li>
                    <li>fear</li>
                    <li>righteousness</li>
                </ul>
